# Synthetic example: insufficient dimensions

## User request

> Will this sectional from a listing photo fit through my entry and under the living-room soffit? The room looks about 12 feet wide.

## Correct response shape

**Verdict:** insufficient evidence.

The photo and approximate room width do not establish the sectional's width, height, depth, packaging or disassembly state, soffit clearance, or the route through the entry. A clear footprint check also would not prove delivery.

Request the first decisive input only: the sectional's exact width × height × depth, including the original unit and packaged-piece dimensions if it ships in sections. Those dimensions block every requested comparison. Ask for the soffit and route measurements only after the item dimensions are known and only if they remain necessary.

Stop there. Do not add conditional maximum-size, fit, height, route, or alternate-pose suggestions while that decisive input is missing.

Do not create a placeholder with guessed dimensions and report it as a verified fit.

**Open dimension-only footprint pre-check:** unavailable — the room and item footprints are not exact rectangular measurements.
