# Contributing to Pascal Editor

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome all kinds of contributions — bug fixes, new features, documentation, and ideas.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.3+ and Node.js 20.9+

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pascalorg/editor.git
cd editor
bun install
bun dev
```

The editor will be running at **http://localhost:3002**. That's it!

### Optional

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add a Google Maps API key if you want address search functionality. The editor works fully without it.

## Making changes

### Code style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. Before submitting a PR:

```bash
bun check        # Check for issues
bun check:fix    # Auto-fix issues
```

### Tests

Run the whole suite from the repo root:

```bash
bun run test     # every package, via Turborepo
```

Run one package while you work on it:

```bash
bun --cwd packages/core run test
```

Use `bun run test`, not bare `bun test`. `test` is one of Bun's own
subcommands, so `bun test` never reaches the package script — it runs Bun's
collector over every file it can find, including compiled copies under `dist/`,
and reports inflated counts. `bun run test` goes through Turborepo, which
builds workspace dependencies first (several packages import theirs from
`dist/`) and runs each package's own scoped test script.

### Project structure

| Package | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `packages/core` | Scene schema, state management, systems — no UI |
| `packages/viewer` | 3D rendering with React Three Fiber |
| `apps/editor` | The full editor app (Next.js) |

A key rule: **`packages/viewer` must never import from `apps/editor`**. The viewer is a standalone component; editor-specific behavior is injected via props/children.

### Building a plugin

New node kinds and sidebar panels can ship as a plugin instead of editing the built-ins. Read [Create a plugin](https://editor.pascal.app/docs/developers/plugins) for the contract, and clone [`pascalorg/plugin-trees`](https://github.com/pascalorg/plugin-trees) as a worked example.

## Submitting a PR

1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** and test locally with `bun dev`
3. **Run `bun check` and `bun run test`** to make sure linting and tests pass
4. **Open a PR** with a clear description of what changed and why
5. **Link related issues** if applicable (e.g., "Fixes #42")

### PR tips

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include screenshots or recordings for visual changes
- If you're unsure about an approach, open an issue or discussion first

## Reporting bugs

Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) template. Include steps to reproduce — this helps us fix things faster.

## Suggesting features

Use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) template, or start a [Discussion](https://github.com/pascalorg/editor/discussions) if you want to brainstorm first.
