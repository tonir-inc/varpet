/**
 * Self-healing backstop for wall geometry: every registered wall whose mesh
 * still carries the mount-time PLACEHOLDER geometry must eventually rebuild,
 * no matter what consumed its dirty mark or when the wall system mounted.
 *
 * Why it exists: a live session (QA f2 probe5/probe6 — scene loaded with
 * the Bones X-ray already active) surfaced all 24 walls stuck on their
 * degenerate placeholder collision meshes indefinitely: no wall on the
 * level ever became a ray target, so the hidden-wall selection gate could
 * not engage even in principle. The renderer marks a wall dirty exactly
 * once, on mount — if that one mark is consumed while the rebuild loop
 * isn't looking (system mounted late, mark cleared by an unrelated flow,
 * suspense unmount/remount), nothing ever re-marks it. This sweep closes
 * that class: placeholder + not dirty → re-mark, and the normal rebuild
 * path takes it from there. Idempotent and cheap (one geometry probe per
 * wall, run every `WALL_PLACEHOLDER_SWEEP_INTERVAL` frames).
 *
 * Placeholder detection: `createPlaceholderGeometry` (packages/nodes,
 * shared/placeholder-geometry.ts) mints a 3-vertex degenerate triangle and
 * stamps `userData.placeholder`. Real wall extrusions always carry far more
 * vertices, so the vertex-count signature doubles as a fallback for
 * placeholders minted before the stamp existed.
