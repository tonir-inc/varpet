// The surface the active placement/move ghost is currently snapped to: a contact
// point (world space) and the surface's outward unit normal. Published each frame
// by the placement tools (the item coordinator + the drawn-kind tools) and read
// by the grid so its snap patch sits at the ghost's height AND orients to the
// surface — horizontal on a floor / shelf top, vertical in a wall plane.
//
// A plain module singleton (not a store): both writer and reader run inside
// `useFrame`, so reactivity would only add overhead. The vectors are reused, so
// readers must consume them within the same frame.
