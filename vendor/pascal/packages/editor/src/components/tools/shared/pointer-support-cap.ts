 * cursor indicates).
 *
 * The grid event plane rides at the ghost's last height, so its hit point
 * alone can't be trusted (that feedback loop is what made a ghost under an
 * elevated deck blink between the deck top and the ground). But camera →
 * hit reconstructs the true pointer ray regardless of the plane height,
 * and the nearest slab plane that ray crosses inside its rendered polygon
 * IS the surface under the cursor — the deck top when aiming at the deck,
 * the floor/ground when aiming underneath it. The same reasoning applies
 * to the cursor XZ: the event plane's hit is skewed along the ray whenever
 * the plane sits on a different storey than the pointed surface, so
 * callers should place at `localPoint` / `worldPoint`, not the event hit.
 *
 * When the ray crosses no slab, the surface is the level base — and on the
 * storey that sits on the ground, that base is the sculpted terrain rather
 * than a plane, so `elevation` varies with XZ. Everything downstream already
 * treats it as a varying scalar, which is why terrain needs no new axis here.
 *
 * Returns null when no level is active (callers fall back to the
 * uncapped max election and the raw event hit).
