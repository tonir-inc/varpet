/**
 * Render-time slab polygon rules.
 *
 * Slab nodes store the wall-centerline polygon (auto slabs) or the drawn
 * polygon (manual slabs) — render offsets are NEVER stored in node data.
 * At geometry build time each polygon edge is SPLIT at the clipped span
 * boundaries of every overlapping candidate (sibling slab edges and wall
 * centerlines in the adoption band) and each sub-edge is classified
 * independently — a single stored edge can be backed differently along
 * its span (two rooms offset diagonally share a wall only where they
 * overlap, so one room's edge is interior beside the sibling and its own
 * facade elsewhere). Each sub-edge is PROJECTED onto an absolute target
 * line:
 *
 *  - INTERIOR — a sibling slab has a collinear, overlapping edge across
 *    it (directly, or across the same wall's footprint band). Projected
 *    EXACTLY onto a shared line so both neighbours emit the same seam
 *    and tile with no gap or overlap. Equal-height rooms partition the
 *    real wall band at its centerline. At an unequal-height boundary, the
 *    higher slab carries the full band to the lower room's wall face and
 *    the lower slab terminates at that same plane. This closes the step
 *    below the raised wall without lowering the wall or exposing a pocket.
 *    Without a wall, the target is the midline between the stored edges.
 *    The coincident vertical seam faces carry opposite outward
 *    normals and every slab material is front-side, so at most one face
 *    renders per view — no z-fighting.
 *  - WALL-BACKED — no slab neighbour across the edge, but the sub-edge
 *    lies inside a wall's footprint band (lateral distance from the
 *    centerline within half-thickness + adoption tolerance). Projected
 *    to the wall's OUTER face line so the slab reaches flush with the
 *    facade regardless of where the stored edge sits inside the band —
 *    this self-heals legacy data stored at wall faces or with old baked
 *    render offsets.
 *  - FREE — no neighbour, no wall. Rendered exactly as drawn.
 *
 * The whole machinery exists to make ROOM FLOORS tile with the walls
 * standing on them, so it only applies to GROUNDED slabs (underside on
 * the level plane) and recessed pools. A floating deck keeps its drawn
 * polygon exactly — it must not grow into a wall it happens to float
 * beside — and is symmetrically ignored as a seam target by its
 * grounded siblings.
 *
 * Sub-edges of one edge with different projections are joined by a
 * perpendicular STEP connector at the breakpoint. Breakpoints sit on
 * candidate span boundaries — wall junctions — so the step's vertical
 * face lands inside the crossing wall's footprint and stays hidden
 * under the wall body.
