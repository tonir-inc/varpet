 * 2D floor-plan move handler for zone. Delegates to the shared polygon
 * centroid-pivot mover — the zone's centroid snaps to the (grid-snapped,
 * Figma-aligned) cursor. Zone has no `holes`, which the helper handles.
 *
 * Previously zone had no move target and fell through to the overlay's
 * generic free-translate path, which committed a `position` field zone
 * doesn't have (the polygon never moved on commit). Routing through this
 * polygon mover translates the actual vertices. `meshY = 0`.
