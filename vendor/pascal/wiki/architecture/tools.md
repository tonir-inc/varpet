# Tools

*Editor tools and registry-owned placement interactions.*

Applies to: `apps/editor/components/tools/**` and `packages/nodes/src/*/{tool,floorplan-tool}.tsx`.

Tools are React components that capture user input (pointer, keyboard) and translate it into `useScene` mutations. Cross-kind and application-level tools live in `apps/editor/components/tools/`. A registry-owned node kind may colocate its 3D `def.tool` and floorplan tool extension in `packages/nodes/src/<kind>/`; this keeps the complete kind registration removable and discoverable as one unit. These components may consume the public editor interaction APIs, but must not add app-specific state or import from `apps/editor`.

## Lifecycle

`ToolManager` reads `useEditor` (phase + mode + tool) and mounts the active tool component. When the tool changes, the old component unmounts, cleaning up any transient state.

See `apps/editor/components/tools/tool-manager.tsx`.

> **What the user is doing right now** is owned by the interaction state machine, not by tool-local flags. A tool that starts a placement / move / handle / reshape / box-select / paint interaction enters it through `useInteractionScope.begin(...)` and leaves through `end()` — see [interaction-scope](interaction-scope.md). Do not add a new `useEditor` flag for a new interaction.

## Tool Categories by Phase

**Site**
- `site-boundary-editor` — draw/edit property boundary polygon

**Structure**
- `wall-tool` — draw walls segment by segment
- `slab-tool` + `slab-boundary-editor` + `slab-hole-editor`
- `ceiling-tool` + `ceiling-boundary-editor` + `ceiling-hole-editor`
- `roof-tool`
- `door-tool` + `door-move-tool`
- `window-tool` + `window-move-tool`
- `item-tool` + `item-move-tool`
- `zone-tool` + `zone-boundary-editor`

**Furnish**
- `item-tool` — place furniture

**Shared utilities**
- `polygon-editor` — reusable boundary/hole editing logic
- `cursor-sphere` — 3D cursor visualisation

## Pattern

```tsx
// apps/editor/components/tools/my-tool/index.tsx
import { useScene } from '@pascal-app/core'
import { useEditor } from '../../store/use-editor'

export function MyTool() {
  const createNode = useScene(s => s.createNode)
  const setTool = useEditor(s => s.setTool)

  // Pointer handlers mutate the scene store directly.
  // No local geometry — use a renderer for any preview mesh.

  return (
    <mesh onPointerDown={handleDown} onPointerMove={handleMove}>
      {/* ghost / preview geometry only */}
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

## Rules

- **Tools mutate `useScene` for committed changes and `useLiveTransforms` for ephemeral drag state.** A tool's end-of-interaction write (click-to-commit, release-to-commit) goes to `useScene` and is captured in undo history. Per-mouse-move previews go to `useLiveTransforms` so history and subscribers aren't spammed.
- **Live-drag exception for direct mesh transforms.** During an active drag a tool may apply a transform offset directly to `sceneRegistry.nodes.get(id).position`/`rotation`/`scale` *when and only when* the same offset is mirrored into `useLiveTransforms` for that node. This exception exists because the 3D renderers don't reconcile `useLiveTransforms` onto `mesh.position` yet; once a `LiveTransformSystem` does that, this exception goes away. Conditions:
  - The mesh offset must mirror the `useLiveTransforms` entry (**same exact value**, not "same conceptual translation"), so anything reading `useLiveTransforms` sees the same preview as the 3D view. `ParametricNodeRenderer` (used for every kind that ships `def.geometry`) binds `<group position={liveTransform.position}>` via React — every Zustand notification re-renders and reconciles the group's position back to whatever value `useLiveTransforms` holds. If `mesh.position.set(delta)` and `useLiveTransforms.set({ position: someOtherValue })` disagree, the two writes fight every frame and the user sees jitter during the drag.
  - **For position-based kinds (spawn / item / column)**: the `position` field on the node IS the group's local-frame position, so `useLiveTransforms.position` should hold the live world position of the node (matches the eventual `scene.update`).
  - **For polygon-based kinds (slab / fence / ceiling / wall)**: the node has no `position` field — the canonical group position is `[0,0,0]` with geometry built in level-local coords. `useLiveTransforms.position` must hold the **delta** the tool wants to translate by (`[deltaX, 0, deltaZ]`), not the world location of the polygon's center. The cursor sphere position (which IS the translated polygon center) is tracked separately via React `useState`, not `useLiveTransforms`.
  - The offset must be cleared on tool unmount, cancel, *and* commit — both `mesh.position.set(0, 0, 0)` and `useLiveTransforms.clear(id)`.
  - The tool must not generate or mutate geometry in this path — only transform writes. Geometry generation still belongs in a core system.
- **No business logic in tools** — delegate geometry/constraint rules to core systems.
- **Snapping is mode-driven, not a held-Shift bypass.** Placement, move, rotate, resize,
  endpoint drag, and handle drag are guided building — grid/object snapping, canonical angle
  increments, alignment guides, distance feedback — but the active behaviour is an explicit,
  always-visible, **per-context** mode (the contextual HUD chip), not a hidden held key:
  - **Shift (tap)** cycles the snapping mode for the active context (`wall` grid/lines/angles/off ·
    `item` lines/grid/off · `polygon` grid/lines/off — one persisted mode per context).
  - **Alt (hold)** is force / free: commit the raw cursor past snap *and* past an invalid /
    colliding drop. It is the only momentary "bypass" key (plus the vertical-riser carve-out for MEP runs).
  - **Ctrl (tap)** cycles the grid step.
  - Read snapping through the single path — `isGridSnapActive()` / `isMagneticSnapActive()` /
    `isAngleSnapActive()` (`store/use-editor`), which resolve the active mode from the interaction
    scope via `getActiveSnapContext()`. **Never** read `event.shiftKey` / `event.nativeEvent.shiftKey` /
    `modifiers.shiftKey` to bypass snapping, and never apply a grid step that isn't gated on
    `isGridSnapActive()` (`const step = isGridSnapActive() ? gridSnapStep : 0`). A snappable kind declares
    `NodeDefinition.snapProfile` (`'item' | 'structural'`) so its context, mode-set, and chip fall out
    with no per-kind switch. The contextual HUD renders the snapping chip for **any** tool that resolves
    to a snap context — `helper-manager` gates the generic `RegisteredToolHelper` on `snapContext` (or
    `continuationContext`), not on the presence of hand-written `def.toolHints`, so a snappable draft tool
    with no bespoke hints (e.g. `zone`) still advertises the Shift = cycle control it already honors. See
    [interaction-scope](interaction-scope.md) § "Snapping mode & modifiers" and `lib/snapping-mode.ts`.
  - **Sanctioned exception — wall connect snap.** Wall drafting keeps a tight, mode-independent
    "connect" snap so a room can still close in the non-magnetic modes (`grid` / `angles` / `off`):
    within `WALL_CONNECT_SNAP_RADIUS` (0.05 m, `components/tools/wall/wall-snap-geometry.ts`) of an
    existing wall's endpoint / midpoint / crossing / body, the drafted point sticks onto it (and the
    beacon shows). This is *connectivity*, not alignment — the snap runs from the already
    mode-positioned point, so grid quantise / angle lock / free placement are respected right up to
    the wall and only the last few cm stick. It is **not** a Shift bypass and must not be gated on
    modifiers. See `snapWallDraftPointDetailed` in `components/tools/wall/wall-drafting.ts`.
  - **Sanctioned exception — lean-to structural connection snap.** Moving or resizing a
    `lean-to-extension` keeps a tight, mode-independent edge/height catch to a neighboring
    extension. This is connectivity: the joined roofs become one structural run with shared
    gutter ends and a single joint post. It runs after the active grid/free proposal and is
    bypassed only by held Alt. The same rule applies in 2D and 3D.
- **Constraints and guides can be decoupled.** When a stronger constraint owns the proposal —
  a wall segment's 45° lock while in `angles` mode — the tool may still publish passive dashed
  alignment/proximity guides as long as it does not apply the guide snap delta. Use this for chained
  wall segments: users keep the fast constrained draft but still see proximity feedback for later points.
- **Vertical structural datums use their own ephemeral guide channel.** Slab, ceiling, wall-base,
  and fence-base elevation handles resolve same-level structural Y targets through scalar snap
  callbacks, then publish a short horizontal datum + elevation readout only while exactly aligned.
  The payload is owner-scoped and cleared through the handle descriptor's `onDragEnd`; it is editor
  feedback, never a scene node. Do not encode Y datums into the floor-plane XZ alignment store or
  the wall-opening guide store — their coordinate and lifecycle contracts differ.
- **Help mirrors the model.** The shortcut dialog and the contextual HUD are part of the interaction
  contract: they describe the always-visible mode chip + `Alt` = force, **not** a hidden Shift bypass.
  The HUD is driven by the active interaction scope, so it shows only the current context's controls.
- **Preview geometry is local** — transient meshes shown while a tool is active live in the tool component, not in the scene store.
- **Clean up on unmount** — remove any pending/incomplete nodes *and* any live transforms/mesh offsets when the tool unmounts.
- **Tools must not import from `@pascal-app/viewer`** — use the scene store and core hooks only. `sceneRegistry` is exported from `@pascal-app/core` and is the allowed door into the Three.js graph for the narrow purposes above.
- Each tool should handle a single, well-scoped interaction. Split complex tools (e.g. "draw + move") into separate components selected by `useEditor`.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create `apps/editor/components/tools/<name>/index.tsx`.
2. Register the tool in `ToolManager` under the correct phase and mode.
3. Add the tool identifier to the `useEditor` tool union type.
4. If the tool requires new node types, add schema + renderer + system first.

## 2D ↔ 3D behavioral parity (default expectation)

The 2D floor-plan view and the 3D view are two presentations of the **same** edit. Whenever a behavior is applicable to both, it must exist in both — the *mechanism* may differ (a 3D raycast hover vs a plan-space nearest-wall query; a real mesh ghost vs an SVG symbol), but the *felt behavior* should match. When you add or change an interaction in one view, port it to the other in the same change, or write down why it genuinely doesn't apply.

Concretely, door/window placement/move keeps these in lockstep across `{door,window}/move-tool.tsx` (3D) and `{door,window}/floorplan-move.ts` (2D):

- **Snap target**: nearest wall to the true cursor (shared `findClosestWallInPlan` / wall raycast), free-follow off-wall, commit only on a host.
- **Move SFX**: a soft `sfx:grid-snap` click per grid step while sliding (free-follow plan XZ or on-wall along-X, quantized + deduped so it isn't a machine-gun) and a soft `sfx:item-pick` cue on the floor→wall snap. Both tools carry an identical `tickGridStep` / `tickWallSnap` pair — keep them in sync.
- **R-flip** facing mid-placement, **Shift** to free snap/alignment (guides stay visible) and force-place over collisions, faithful ghost/symbol, deterministic single-undo commit.

Tells that you've broken parity: a sound/guide/snap that fires in 3D but is silent in 2D (or vice-versa), or a fix landed in one move file but not its sibling. The two move files are deliberately near-mirrors; diff them when in doubt.

**Navigation is part of parity.** Movement learned in one view works in the other (WASD, Space + drag, middle drag, wheel, orbit), and split view keeps both in sync through `navigationSyncPose`. In 2D-only view the 3D canvas is paused (`renderPaused`), so nothing driven from its frame loop reaches the plan: the plan owns WASD and the orbit buttons there itself (`components/editor/floorplan-panel.tsx`, sharing `lib/keyboard-pan.ts` with `custom-camera-controls.tsx` — physical keys, same guards and speed) and publishes the pose to 3D when the move ends, while the camera stands down. A navigation input that only exists on the camera side is a 2D regression waiting to happen.

**Group selection acts on the selection.** Group move / rotate / duplicate transform the selected participants only; connected walls outside the selection stretch at their shared ends (`LinkedNeighbor`). Their footprint comes from plan data, never from meshes: `groupPlanBounds` (`components/editor/group-transform-shared.ts`) reads wall outlines, polygon rings and fence runs in the level frame, and measures meshes only for placed objects (fresh bounds, `userData.placeholder` skipped, anchor as fallback). A world-space mesh box mapped into the level frame lands beside the meshes under a rotated building, and in 2D-only view meshes may be unbuilt. The 2D dashed box, the 3D rotate gizmo and keyboard R/T all pivot on that box's centre.

**A room's slab and ceiling deselect together in the plan.** The floor plan draws the ceiling as an unfilled outline under the walls (`fill="none"` is click-through, see below), so a marquee can select it but a click can't reach it. Removing either surface from the selection removes its same-outline counterpart: slab and ceiling declare `extensions['pascal:editor/floorplan'].selectionCounterparts` (`packages/nodes/src/shared/surface-counterparts.ts`) and `applyEntrySelection` asks the registry, so the plan never names a kind. Adding stays single, and 3D keeps single toggles because each surface is clickable there.

Plan-view surface movement retains only the original host while the footprint centre
is supported. Exiting commits a level-frame floor pose with support re-elected and
attachment links removed atomically. Plan view never acquires a new host or cycles
surfaces; fresh placement stays on the floor. Generated designs enable body drag
through `extensions['pascal:editor/floorplan'].directDrag`, which does not enable
plain body drag in 3D.

## Move coexistence: 2D `FloorplanRegistryMoveOverlay` + legacy 3D mover

While a kind is mid-migration its move can run through two paths at once: the registry-driven 2D `FloorplanRegistryMoveOverlay` (`def.floorplanMoveTarget`) and the legacy 3D mover (e.g. `MoveItemContent`). Both react to `setMovingNode(node)`, both mount, both want to commit. Two pitfalls surfaced and have stable fixes; replicate the patterns when porting another kind to coexist.

### Pitfall: the 2D cleanup clobbering the 3D commit

`FloorplanRegistryMoveOverlay` pauses scene history at mount and snapshots the moving node. If the user actually commits in 3D, the 3D path writes new state and clears `movingNode`. The 2D overlay then unmounts — and its cleanup `useEffect` would call `updateNodes(snapshot)`, overwriting the just-committed 3D state with the original.

Fix in `floorplan-registry-move-overlay.tsx`: gate the cleanup revert on a `hasMovedSinceStart` flag that is only set inside `onMove` **after** the `target.closest('[data-floorplan-scene]')` guard. If no 2D apply ever ran, the divergence in scene state must be an external committer's — skip the revert, just resume history. Symptom when missing: items snap back to their pre-drag position / rotation on 3D commit.

### Pitfall: `useDraftNode.destroy()` clobbering the 2D commit

Mirror problem in the other direction. The legacy 3D mover's `usePlacementCoordinator` cleanup unconditionally calls `draftNode.destroy()`, which for adopted moves writes the original position back to scene. If the 2D path committed first, the destroy reverts it.

Fix in `use-draft-node.ts`: in move-mode `destroy()`, compare the live scene position to the `adopt()`-time snapshot. If they diverge, an external committer has already written the new value — skip the restore (and the mesh reset). Cancellation paths (Escape) still revert, because they revert before unmount so live == snapshot at destroy time.

### Pitfall: pointermove fires globally; treat 3D-canvas events as out of scope

`FloorplanRegistryMoveOverlay` listens to `window` pointermove. When the user drags in 3D the listener still fires — without a target check it converts 3D-canvas client coords through the floor-plan SVG's CTM, producing garbage plan coordinates that fight the 3D mover's mesh updates.

Always gate `onMove` (and `onPointerUp`) with `target.closest('[data-floorplan-scene]')` so the 2D path only acts when the pointer is actually over the floor plan scene.

## `useLiveTransforms` contract is per-kind, not generic

The store name suggests a uniform contract; the writes in practice are not. Document the frame on the writer side; consumers must either know the kind or be narrowed.

| Writer | `position` frame | `rotation` frame |
|---|---|---|
| `usePlacementCoordinator` (item floor / wall / ceiling) | world plan (level-local) | world Y |
| `door` / `window` move tools | wall-local | wall-local (0 or π) |
| `slab` / `ceiling` / `fence` / polygon-based movers | position **delta** (`[Δx, 0, Δz]`) | unused / 0 |
| `column` / `roof` / `elevator` / `spawn` / single-position kinds | world plan | world Y |

Anything that subscribes to `useLiveTransforms` to inform 2D rendering needs to handle these frames explicitly. The `FloorplanRegistryLayer` override currently branches by kind: `item` / `shelf` / `column` are treated as world-plan (it copies `live.position` onto the effective node and forces `parentId: null` so the resolver skips the parent-chain transform), while `slab` / `ceiling` / `zone` are treated as a polygon **delta** (it translates the polygon vertices by `live.position`). Each kind added to the live-drag path grows this consumer-side switch; the preferred long-term fix is to standardise the frame at the writer so the consumer stops branching by `node.type`.

## Data-driven live drag: `useLiveNodeOverrides`, never per-tick `useScene`

`useLiveTransforms` (above) carries a rigid position/rotation offset — right when the renderer can preview the move by transforming the node's group. It's **wrong** when the geometry is *recomputed from data fields* (a wall re-miters from its `start`/`end`, an opening re-cuts its host wall, an endpoint drag reshapes the segment and cascades to linked walls): the shape itself changes, so there's no rigid offset to apply. Those preview via **`useLiveNodeOverrides`** (`@pascal-app/core`) — the tool publishes the changed fields per tick (`set(id, patch)` / `setMany(...)`) and the geometry systems merge them (`getEffectiveWall` in 3D, the floor-plan sibling-override merge in 2D, `getEffectiveNode` in panels). The scene store stays untouched during the drag; on commit the tool clears overrides and writes it **once** (`resumeSceneHistory → updateNodes([...]) → pauseSceneHistory`), so the gesture is a single undo step. Esc/unmount just clears overrides — cancel is free.

**Writing `useScene.updateNodes`/`updateNode` per `grid:move` tick is a blocker:** it replaces the `nodes` map ref, so every `useScene(s => s.nodes)` subscriber app-wide (panels, HUD, tooltips, floor plan, catalog) re-renders each frame → FPS collapse. (`markDirty` per tick is fine for a bounded gesture — it never calls `set()` and the marks drain every frame; an animation loop that marks dirty for as long as it runs is not, see `node-definitions.md` § "`geometry` + `system`".) Reference: `packages/nodes/src/wall/{move-tool,move-endpoint-tool}.tsx`.

## Floorplan registry: per-node subscriptions, stable props

`FloorplanRegistryLayer` draws one `FloorplanRegistryEntry` per node. The perf invariant — a live drag must re-render only the changed node(s), not all ~150 entries — rests on three things, and breaking any of them is a re-render-flood regression that still type-checks and passes tests (see `floorplan-registry-layer.tsx`):

- Each entry subscribes to **its own slice** — `useLiveTransforms(s => s.transforms.get(id))` / `useLiveNodeOverrides(s => s.overrides.get(id))`, never the whole Map. This works because the live stores write a fresh value only for the changed node (the Map is cloned but unchanged value refs are reused), so an unchanged node's selector stays identity-stable and Zustand skips it. The parent subscribes only to the stable id list.
- `FloorplanRegistryEntry` and `InteractiveGeometry` are `memo`'d, so the parent must pass **referentially stable props** (hoisted styles, `useCallback` handlers, memoized descriptors) — a fresh inline object/handler per entry defeats the memo.
- Sibling-dependent geometry (wall miters, opening cuts) invalidates via a **per-node sibling epoch** bumped from a store `subscribe` (`computeAffectedSiblingIds`), not a whole-layer re-render.

## Wall-attached node rotations must be wall-local

`door` / `window` / wall-attached `item` are children of the wall mesh in 3D. The wall's `mesh.rotation.y = -atan2(dy, dx)`. The child node's `rotation.y` therefore lives in the wall's local frame and composes with the wall's rotation at render time.

The 3D source of truth is `calculateItemRotation(normal)` in `editor/src/components/tools/item/placement-math.ts`, which returns 0 (front face) or π (back face). Any 2D move helper that writes `node.rotation[1]` for wall-attached nodes must produce the same wall-local value. Writing a world-space rotation gets you orientation bugs that vary with wall direction — typically 90° on horizontal walls and 180° on vertical walls (which sometimes "looks OK" by symmetry, which is worse — silent corruption).

See `nodes/src/shared/wall-attach-target.ts`'s `WallHit.itemRotation`. Side determination there is calibrated to the same convention: in wall-local space the wall extends along +X, the front-face normal is +Z, and `perpRaw >= 0` is the front side.

## Move / placement: disable raycast on the moved mesh

A 3D move tool that follows the cursor by writing `mesh.position.set(x, 0, z)` runs into a feedback loop: as the mesh tracks the cursor it sits between the camera and the grid plane, so R3F's raycaster hits the moved mesh first → only `${kind}:move` fires → `grid:move` stops firing → the cursor snapshot (used as the commit position) freezes at its initial value. The user clicks at a new spot and the node commits at the starting one.

Fix in `MoveRegistryNodeTool`: at drag-start, traverse the moved mesh and overwrite `child.raycast = () => {}` on every descendant; restore the originals in the effect's cleanup. The ray now passes through the moved mesh, hits the grid plane, and `grid:move` keeps firing.

`MoveRegistryNodeTool` uses the shared surface resolver for kinds whose `floorPlaced`
capability applies. Neither `hostable` nor `hostable.parents` gates the session. It
subscribes to registered physical host kinds and lets their surface providers accept
or reject the child; the protocol's non-physical denylist excludes containers and guides.
Mounted procedural recipes stay in their separate session. The shared surface resolver owns shelf row election and fit. Shelf
entry checks the upward normal; subsequent moves can switch rows over side faces.
Every shelf placement checks the board region, including movement and rotation; see
[Surface fit policy](#surface-fit-policy). Offset procedural bounds
keep the footprint centered under a new cursor hit and put its bottom on the board.

While hosted, grid dispatch waits until both DOM listeners have run and matches the
native pointer event to the host hit. Unhosted registry floor moves apply immediately;
a subsequent host hit in the same dispatch replaces the floor preview. Both the catalog coordinator and registry mover use
`shared/shelf-stickiness.ts`: shelf leave events retain hosting, and a grid ray must
miss the shelf's local volume (with the existing 8 cm margin) before detaching.
Item-surface leaves still detach immediately. Existing hosted moves preserve their
grab offset until switching hosts or detaching; R/T rotates around the stored local
position. Attachment clears the child's slab support; detachment uses the existing
floor support election. Procedural queries compose shelf and nested cabinet transforms and apply slab
lift only at the level-parented ancestor.

Parent transitions and hosted poses preview in `useScene` with history paused so
React can reparent the renderer. Hosted previews use that stored local pose (no
world-plan live transform); the footprint box is converted to the level frame.
Commit restores the drag-start parent and pose before one tracked write. Cleanup
restores both fresh and existing nodes without history, resets pointer/grab state,
and leaves fresh drafts alive; explicit cancel deletes fresh drafts. The 2D item
move path, also used by procedural items, composes the host transform and retains the
current shelf row or counter surface while the rotated footprint remains contained.
Outside it, the legacy level-detach/source-Y behavior remains pending slice F, together
with acquiring and cycling surfaces in plan view.

Shelf `relations.hosts` includes catalog and procedural children. Registry moves,
3D handle previews/cleanup, and shelf 2D move/resize/rotate previews cascade dirty
marks on each tick so children are re-marked after a renderer drains the set.
Shelf `geometryKey` excludes children, keeping the boards stable during attachment.
Cabinet geometry and neighbor keys include only structural cabinet/module child IDs.
`geometryChildTypes` also filters the viewer's live child override key: shelves declare
none, cabinets/modules declare only their structural child kinds.

Both movers route cabinet events through `resolveSurfacePlacement`. Counters retain
free XZ movement with grid snapping; they do not elect module or span centers. The
provider chooses the real span or bar height from the hit, while the optional `origin`
keeps a grabbed or off-origin child's pose separate from the contact that elected it.
Full rotated footprints are checked after snapping against the span and its holes.
Counter stickiness intersects the published surface regions, never the run's bounding
volume, so real gaps and sink openings remain exits. The hit run owns the child,
including a nested corner leg. Run inspector edits and registered resize handles stage
their structural changes, carry child Y by the old/new stable surface height, and reject
an edit that removes or invalidates an occupied surface. These are editing-path rules;
arbitrary raw scene writes do not invoke this reconciliation.


The same applies to placement previews — see `nodes/src/shelf/preview.tsx` for the `(obj as { raycast: () => void }).raycast = () => {}` pattern. A preview that captures rays starves the placement tool's own `grid:move` snapshot.

## Move / placement: commit handlers listen to every `${kind}:click`

R3F's pointer raycaster dispatches the click event to whichever mesh is closest, even when the user thinks they're clicking the ground. A tool that only listens to `grid:click` misses commits whenever the click ray lands on a wall face, a shelf side, an item, or the still-being-placed cursor mesh itself. Symptom: clicks visibly hit "near" the cursor but the tool does nothing.

The fix is the pattern used by `ShelfTool` and `MoveRegistryNodeTool`: keep the latest `grid:move` snapshot in a ref, then register one shared commit handler against `grid:click` **and** every common kind-click event:

```ts
const CLICK_TRIGGER_KINDS = [
  'shelf', 'item', 'slab', 'ceiling', 'wall',
  'fence', 'column', 'roof', 'roof-segment',
  'stair', 'stair-segment',
] as const

emitter.on('grid:click', commitAtCursor)
for (const kind of CLICK_TRIGGER_KINDS) {
  emitter.on(`${kind}:click` as `${typeof kind}:${EventSuffix}`, commitAtCursor as never)
}
```

The commit reads `lastCursorRef.current` (set by `grid:move`), not the click event's position — clicks on vertical surfaces carry the hit point on that surface, which can be metres away from the cursor the user was visually targeting.

## Move tools must preserve the node's actual rotation in `useLiveTransforms`

A tool that writes `useLiveTransforms.set(id, { position: [x, 0, z], rotation: 0 })` during drag wipes the node's true Y-rotation for the duration of the drag. `ParametricNodeRenderer` reads `liveTransform.rotation` and applies `<group rotation={[0, liveTransform.rotation, 0]}>`, so the moved node visually un-rotates to 0 the moment the tool mounts, then snaps back to its real rotation on commit when the live transform clears. Users perceive that snap as "the node went to a weird position."

Capture the original `node.rotation[1]` at mount time and forward it on every `set`:

```ts
const originalRotationY = useMemo(() => {
  const r = (node as { rotation?: unknown }).rotation
  return typeof r === 'number' ? r : Array.isArray(r) ? (r[1] ?? 0) : 0
}, [node])

// in onMove:
useLiveTransforms.getState().set(node.id, {
  position: [x, 0, z],
  rotation: originalRotationY,
})
```

If the tool *also* rotates the node during the drag, it should drive `rotation` from the current tool state — not from 0, not from the stale node value.

## Wall lifecycle: draw, split, merge

Walls are drawn as a line chain or a rectangle (`R` toggles inside the wall tool; the HUD's Shape chip cycles the same `useWallDrawingMode` store, `packages/nodes/src/wall/drawing-mode.ts`). In 2D the rectangle tool only claims clicks and publishes its first corner to `useFloorplanDraftPreview`; the panel's linear draft layer draws the four mitered walls with the line draft's plates and guides, so cursor, snapping and alignment are the line wall's own (`packages/nodes/src/wall/floorplan-tool.tsx`).

Split is a HUD-driven loop cut that lives entirely in `packages/nodes/src/wall/`: `split-session.ts` opens the wall's own `reshaping` scope (`reshape: 'split'`, `driver: 'tool'`, which resolves to the `polygon` snap context — see `interaction-scope.md`) and owns every transition of the `split-store.ts` draft; scrolling sets 1–32 cuts, a single cut follows the pointer with the snapping modes, several divide the wall evenly, and a click commits them as one undo step through `planWallDivisions` (core). The editor mounts it through kind-agnostic seams only: `def.affordanceTools.split` (3D markers, `split-tool.tsx`), `extensions['pascal:editor/floorplan'].reshapeLayers.split` (the plan layer, `split-floorplan-layer.tsx`, mounted by `FloorplanRegisteredToolLayer` while the scope runs), `def.affordanceHints.split` (the HUD's cut-count chip and hints, rendered by `HelperManager` like `toolHints`), and `actionMenu.actions` (`actions.tsx`, the Split and Merge buttons `NodeActionMenu` renders for whichever kinds are selected). Any reshape name without a dedicated arm in `ToolManager` resolves the same way, so the next kind-owned reshape needs no editor change. Merge is the inverse (core `planWallMerge`): selected walls that continue each other join into the wall with the most attachments, openings keep their world position, rooms keep one boundary reference; refusals name the difference in the button's tooltip. The join rule (`systems/wall/wall-merge.ts`) is shared with the delete heal.

Modes and parameters of these tools live on keys, the wheel and the HUD (`ToolHint.chip`), not in sidebar option rows or floating panels.

## SVG `fill="none"` is click-through

When emitting a `FloorplanGeometry` polygon that should remain interactive but visually invisible (e.g. an item with a thumbnail image carrying the visual weight), use `fill="transparent"`, not `fill="none"`. The default `pointer-events: visiblePainted` only hit-tests the interior when there's a paint server — `none` is not paint, `transparent` is. Without this the floor-plan layer's wrapping `<g>` never sees the `onPointerDown` and clicks don't select the node.

## Procedural ceiling placement

Procedural recipes declare `mounting: { attachTo: 'ceiling', reference }` with a named, non-repeated +Y top surface. The shared procedural mounted move session handles wall and ceiling previews, snapping, collision checks, Alt force-place for collisions, fresh subtree commits and single-step undo. Ceiling enter/move/click events use ceiling-local XZ; grid fallback shows an unhosted red ghost and cannot commit. The parent is the ceiling, stored Y is zero at the reference, and only yaw rotates (R/T); the rendered pose subtracts the rotated reference so the design hangs flush below the ceiling underside. Core validation enforces polygon containment, holes and level height even with Alt. The 2D move target finds ceiling polygons and uses the same session; glyphs resolve the ceiling frame, while parameter arrows portal through the ceiling frame and floor elevation never applies.


## Surface fit policy

`resolveSurfacePlacement` owns fit for both movers. Strictness follows what the
provider knows about the surface:

- **Declared:** a stable, non-null surface ID requires a `region`. The child's
  rotated hull must fit inside that region after snapping, excluding holes. The
  hull projects all eight corners when full XYZ rotation or offset bounds are
  supplied. Rectangle containment allows 1e-6 m per edge, so a centred, unrotated
  object exactly matching a board fits despite floating-point noise.
- **Hit-derived:** `id: null` has no region. An upward hit identifies support but
  cannot describe an armrest or cushion's outline. The best-effort test compares
  the rotated child's XZ spans to the host's available bounds, with a 1e-6 m
  tolerance. It does not constrain the hit position to a fictitious flat top.
  Hosts without measurable bounds remain permissive.

`HostSurface` is a union: a non-null ID requires `region`, while a null ID has none.
`SurfaceProvider.surfaces()` returns only `DeclaredHostSurface[]`. Untyped plugins
that resolve a declared surface without a region throw an explicit contract error;
they never silently enter the hit-derived fit path. The low-level
`checkFootprint: false` option is for unchecked pose proposals, not valid drops:
it still enforces declaration integrity and acceptance. Both shelf movers check
fit on entry and movement and revalidate rotations before commit.

Provider audit:

| Provider | Published extent |
|---|---|
| Shelf rows | Centred board rectangles. Depth is `D - 0.002 m`. Wall shelves use width `W`; bookshelves with sides and cubbies use `W - 2 × thickness`; open racks and bookshelves without sides use `W - 0.002 m`. A bookshelf's optional bottom board without sides uses `W`, matching its mesh. The mesh and adapter share the board-dimension helper. |
| Cabinet countertops and bars | Each real countertop span and bar slab's rectangle, with its actual centre and half-extents. Counter holes cover sink bowls, faucets and hob footprints. Tall/wall/disabled spans publish nothing. |
| Procedural named surfaces | Evaluated recipe width/depth divided by two, in each surface's own frame. |
| Catalog item hit provider | No declared extent: authored `asset.surface.height` supplies only Y, not a usable XZ boundary. Retains ray-selected freeform placement and the rotated best-effort host-bounds check. |
| Generic hit-derived provider | No declared extent: the upward mesh hit supplies support, optionally bounded by `dragBounds` or `floorPlaced.footprint`. Legacy top-height/side metadata alone is not a region declaration. |

Row election, first-row ties, shelf-volume stickiness and the existing grid snap
functions remain unchanged. In 2D, current-host retention uses this same resolver
and board region; its previous extra whole-shelf rectangle check is gone. Fresh
host acquisition, surface cycling and the existing exit-to-level behavior remain
in surface-hosting slice F. A 2D exit currently chooses the level rather than
refusing a host drop, so it does not publish a surface-refusal label.

A refusal in 3D sets the existing footprint preview red and places a short status
label beside it. `onReject` reaches both movers; the matching floor event cannot
erase the reason or commit the refused drop to the floor. A new floor move or a
valid surface clears it, as do cleanup/cancel. Alt can bypass collision checks,
but not a surface refusal. Rotation retries the attempted host when needed.

| Rejection | Preview wording |
|---|---|
| Footprint outside declared region or exceeding hit-derived host bounds | Doesn't fit this surface |
| Hit inside a hole, or contained footprint overlapping a hole | Over a sink or hob cutout |
| Host ineligible or child rejected by its acceptance predicate | This host doesn't accept this kind of object |
| No supporting surface or invalid hit | No supporting surface here |

The frozen fit table pins both acceptance and refusal for each adapter, with exact
per-verdict counts. Shelf acceptance sweeps every fixture board through interior,
near-edge, centred equality and rotated placements, including grid-on cases. Captured
expected poses stay static during tests; changing fit policy requires reviewing the
verdict changes and retaining coverage of both outcomes.
