# Selection Managers

*Two-layer selection architecture: viewer manager (hierarchy) + editor manager (phase-aware).*

Applies to: `packages/viewer/src/components/viewer/selection-manager.tsx`, `apps/editor/components/editor/selection-manager.tsx`.

There are two selection managers. They are separate components, not the same component configured differently.

| Component | Location | Knows about |
|---|---|---|
| `SelectionManager` | `packages/viewer/src/components/viewer/selection-manager.tsx` | Viewer state only |
| `SelectionManager` (editor) | `apps/editor/components/editor/selection-manager.tsx` | Phase, mode, tool state |

The viewer's manager is the default. The editor mounts its own manager as a child of `<Viewer>`, overriding the default behaviour via the viewer-isolation pattern.

## How Selection Works

**Event flow:**

```
useNodeEvents(node, type) on a renderer mesh
  → emitter.emit('wall:click', NodeEvent)
  → SelectionManager listens via emitter.on(…)
  → calls useViewer.setSelection(…)
  → outliner sync re-runs → Three.js outline updates
```

`useNodeEvents` returns R3F pointer handlers. Spread them onto the mesh:

```tsx
const events = useNodeEvents(node, 'wall')
return <mesh ref={ref} {...events} />
```

Events are suppressed during camera drag (`useViewer.getState().cameraDragging`).

Selection/hover picking is only meaningful while the interaction scope is `idle`
(`selectionEnabled(scope)`). During an active placement/move/etc., the pointer
belongs to that interaction's body and the hot-set narrows which scene objects
are raycast-eligible — see [interaction-scope](interaction-scope.md) for the
hot-set derivation and the overlay scope matrix.

## Viewer Selection Manager

Hierarchical path: **Building → Level → Zone → Elements**

At each level, only the next tier is selectable. Clicking outside deselects. The path is stored in `useViewer`:

```ts
type SelectionPath = {
  buildingId: string | null
  levelId: string | null
  zoneId: string | null
  selectedIds: string[]   // walls, items, slabs, etc.
}
```

`setSelection` has a hierarchy guard: setting `levelId` without `buildingId` resets children. Use `resetSelection()` to clear everything.

Multi-select: `Ctrl/Meta + click` toggles an ID in `selectedIds`; `Shift + click` toggles the same way. Regular click replaces it.

## Editor Selection Manager

Extends selection with phase awareness from `useEditor`. The viewer's `SelectionManager` is **not** mounted in the editor; this one takes its place (injected as a child of `<Viewer>`).

```
phase: 'site'      → selectable: buildings
phase: 'structure' → selectable: walls, zones, slabs, ceilings, roofs, doors, windows
  structureLayer: 'zones'    → only zones
  structureLayer: 'elements' → all structure types
phase: 'furnish'   → selectable: furniture items only
```

Clicking a node of a different phase auto-switches the phase. Double-click drills into a context level.

In Select mode, 3D and 2D canvas selection share the same modifier vocabulary:

- `Ctrl/Meta + click` toggles the clicked object in `selectedIds`.
- `Shift + click` also toggles the clicked canvas object so users can multi-select from
  either viewport. The scene graph keeps file-browser semantics: `Shift + click` selects
  the visible range between the last selected row and the clicked row.
- `Ctrl/Meta + left-drag` on a selected movable object starts direct move from the canvas.
- `Ctrl/Meta + right-drag` on a selected rotatable object starts direct rotation from the
  canvas. Rotation snaps to the default angle increment unless Shift is held during the
  drag.

The floating helper in `packages/editor/src/components/ui/helpers/helper-manager.tsx`
mirrors these rules from current selection state and held modifiers. Keep that helper and
the shortcut dialog in sync when changing selection gestures.

### Session groups (editor-only)

`Ctrl/Cmd+G` / `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+G` create and dissolve **session selection groups** in
`use-session-groups` (not the scene graph). Plain click expands to live members via
`expandIdsForNode`, threaded into all three click paths:
`resolveSelectedIdsForNodeClick` (3D), the registry layer's `applyEntrySelection` (2D
entries), and `resolveFloorplanBackgroundSelection` (2D background hit-test). Alt+click
opts out. See [selection-groups](selection-groups.md).

## Rules

- **Never add selection logic to renderers.** Renderers spread `useNodeEvents` events and stop there. All selection decisions live in the selection manager.
- **Never add editor phase logic to the viewer's SelectionManager.** Phase, mode, and tool awareness belong exclusively in the editor's selection manager.
- **`useViewer` is the single source of truth for selection state.** Both managers read and write through `setSelection` / `resetSelection`. Nothing else should mutate `selection` directly.
- **Outliner arrays are mutated in-place** (not replaced) for performance. Don't assign new arrays to `outliner.selectedObjects` or `outliner.hoveredObjects`.
- **Hover is a separate scalar** (`hoveredId: string | null`), not part of `selectedIds`. Update it via `setHoveredId`.

## Adding Selectability to a New Node Type

1. Add the type to `SelectableNodeType` in the viewer store / selection manager.
2. Make sure its renderer calls `useNodeEvents(node, type)` and spreads the handlers.
3. Add a case to whichever selection strategy needs it (viewer hierarchy level or editor phase).
4. Ensure `useRegistry` is called in the renderer so the outliner can highlight it.
