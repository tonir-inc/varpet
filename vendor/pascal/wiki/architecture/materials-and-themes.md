# Materials & themes (surface colour)

How a node's surfaces get their colour. Applies to: `packages/viewer/src/lib/{materials.ts,scene-themes.ts}`, the per-kind material logic in `packages/viewer/src/systems/<kind>/` and `packages/nodes/src/<kind>/`, and the appearance state in `packages/viewer/src/store/use-viewer.ts`.

## The axes

Appearance is a set of orthogonal axes, all held in `useViewer`:

| State | Values | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `shading` | `'solid' \| 'rendered'` | `solid` = `MeshLambertNodeMaterial`, no SSGI/AO. `rendered` = `MeshStandardNodeMaterial` + SSGI/AO. |
| `textures` | `boolean` | Whether surfaces that have a real material/preset show their texture. |
| `colorPreset` | `'clay' \| 'white' \| 'mono' \| 'blueprint'` | The per-role base palette for untextured surfaces. |
| `sceneTheme` | theme id (`studio`, `mediterranean`, `night`, `verdant`, …) | Lighting + background + ground + per-role colour tints. See [scene themes](#scene-themes). |
| `shadows` | `boolean` | Directional shadow casting (always-on key light; see `lights.tsx`). |
| `edges` | `'off' \| 'soft' \| 'strong'` | Screen-space ink outline in `post-processing.tsx` (`lib/ink-edges.ts`). |

`shading`/`textures`/`colorPreset` are persisted per-context; `shadingByContext` lets the editor default to `solid` and the community viewer to `rendered`.

## Surface roles

Every registry kind may declare one token on its `NodeDefinition` (`packages/core/src/registry/types.ts`):

```ts
surfaceRole?: 'wall' | 'floor' | 'ceiling' | 'roof' | 'joinery' | 'glazing' | 'furnishing'
```

`core` only stores the token — it carries no colour and never imports three.js. The token is what lets a wall, a slab, a column, etc. each resolve a *different* colour from the same palette.

## Resolving a colour

The single source of truth is in `packages/viewer/src/lib/materials.ts`:

```ts
resolveSurfaceColor(role, colorPreset, sceneThemeId?)
  // = getSceneTheme(sceneThemeId).clayTints?.[role]   // theme override, if any
  //   ?? PRESET_PALETTES[colorPreset][role]            // else the preset palette
```

`createSurfaceRoleMaterial(role, colorPreset, side?, sceneThemeId?)` wraps that in a lit `MeshLambertNodeMaterial`, **cached by `role-preset-side-sceneTheme`**. The cache key is why every consumer must thread `sceneTheme` through — otherwise switching themes returns a stale cached material.

## The rule: untextured surfaces are theme-coloured in both modes

For kinds without declared slot defaults, a surface is "textured" only if its node has an explicit `materialPreset` or `material`. Kinds with slot defaults use the slot contract described below.

- **`textures` off** → every surface uses `resolveSurfaceColor(role, …)`.
- **`textures` on** → textured surfaces show their texture; **untextured surfaces still use `resolveSurfaceColor`** (not a hardcoded white/grey default).

So picking the Mediterranean theme gives a blue roof + warm walls without touching the textures toggle. There is no "all white" mode — untextured always means "themed role colour".

### Where it's wired per kind

| Kind | Where the role colour is applied |
|---|---|
| wall | `systems/wall/wall-materials.ts` (`getMaterialsForWall`), re-applied each frame by `wall-cutout.tsx` |
| roof / roof-segment | `systems/roof/roof-materials.ts` (`getRoofMaterialArray`) |
| slab | `nodes/slab/geometry.ts` (`getSlabSlotMaterial`) |
| ceiling | `nodes/ceiling/renderer.tsx` |
| generic registry kinds | `systems/geometry/geometry-system.tsx` → `applyDefaultSurfaceRole` (textures-off) |
| door / window | `systems/{door,window}/*-system.tsx` |
| stair / column / item / elevator | `nodes/<kind>/renderer.tsx` |

Each of these reads `shading`/`textures`/`colorPreset`/`sceneTheme` from `useViewer` (or receives them threaded from `GeometrySystem`) and **must include `sceneTheme` in its material cache key and its rebuild dependency array**, or theme switches won't re-colour. `GeometrySystem` marks every geometry node dirty on any of those changing.

Ceilings and slabs use declared slot defaults in colored (`textures` on) mode.
Ceiling undersides use an opaque `BackSide` material in both appearances; only
`ceiling-grid` blends. Slab top, side/underside and optional terrain skirt meshes
can batch separately. Flat slot defaults share the viewer cache by color, roughness
and shading; slab legacy cached materials carry `__pascalCachedMaterial` so geometry
rebuilds leave shared materials alive. Transparent slot overrides draw themselves.

## Procedural item recipe finishes

Recipe slots keep a required authored hex color and may declare
`finish: 'glass' | 'metal' | 'wood'`. On a generated design's first catalog save,
`snapProceduralSlotsToLibrary` calls `resolveProceduralFinishRef(finish, color)` to
select the curated preset nearest to the authored color in CIE76 Lab (D65).
Ties follow the list order below. Glass always selects `library:preset-glass`;
slots without a finish select the nearest flat library color. Explicit overrides,
including an Authored hex pick, are preserved. The recipe hex is never rewritten.
Existing recipes and scene instances are not automatically resnapped.

| Finish | Library preset id | Label | Representative tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glass | `preset-glass` | Glass | `#87ceeb` |
| Metal | `metal-steel` | Brushed Steel | `#636363` |
| Metal | `metal-chrome` | Chrome | `#c8ccce` |
| Metal | `metal-brass` | Brass | `#b08d57` |
| Metal | `metal-copper` | Copper | `#cc845b` |
| Metal | `metal-polished` | Polished Metal | `#f3f3f3` |
| Metal | `preset-metal` | Metal | `#c7ccd2` |
| Wood | `wood-finewood27` | Finewood 27 | `#a77440` |
| Wood | `wood-woodplank48` | Wood Plank 48 | `#88654c` |
| Wood | `wood-hungarianparquet2` | Hungarian Parquet 2 | `#663020` |
| Wood | `wood-squareparquet21` | Square Parquet 21 | `#3e220d` |

The wood list is owner-curated: two light browns, one medium brown, and one darkest
brown. Metal includes only the six listed surface finishes, excluding Garage Panel
and other panel textures. Brushed Steel, Copper, and Polished Metal still have
surface texture maps; Chrome, Brass, and Metal use flat material properties.

Representative tones live beside the curated references in `library-colors.ts`.
For wood, they are the arithmetic mean of every sRGB pixel's R/G/B channels in the
1024×1024 source base-color WebPs under `apps/editor/public/material/wood/`:
`finewood_27/finewood_27_basecolor.webp`, `woodplank_48/woodplank_48_BaseColor.webp`,
`hungarian_parquet_2/Hungarian Parquet_2_baseColor.webp`, and
`square_parquet_21/Square Pattern Parquet_21_baseColor.webp`.
For textured metals, the equivalent mean uses the 512×512 base level decoded from
`metal/{stainless_steel_brushed,copper_metal,polished_metal}/*_basecolor_512.ktx2`
with `basisu -unpack -no_ktx -etc1_only`. A small Python script used Pillow's
`ImageStat.Stat(image.convert('RGB')).mean`, rounding each channel to the nearest
integer before hex encoding. Flat finishes use `mapProperties.color`.

Studio and the colored scene renderer resolve the actual library preset, retaining
its texture maps and world-scale repeat (currently one tile per metre for these
finishes). Representative tones only drive nearest-color matching and the 2D
bounds glyph: `proceduralSlotColor` uses them for curated library overrides so a
white texture tint does not produce a white glyph. Absent overrides and Authored
picks use the recipe hex; other library and scene-material color resolution is
unchanged.

Glass remains blue `#87ceeb`, transparency enabled, opacity 0.3, with Fresnel
reflections in rendered shading. The recipe hex does not retint that preset.
Monochrome scene appearance still uses the furnishing theme material. Studio's
Authored option clears a saved slot override (or stores the hex on an unsaved
draft), restoring the opaque authored material.

## Custom-mesh face materials

Blocks use the reusable `MaterialRef` model through stable, user-named object slots. `BlockNode.slots` maps slot IDs to `scene:` or `library:` references, `slotNames` stores their editable labels, and each `BlockFace.materialSlot` stores one slot ID. `body` is the permanent base slot and the fallback for unbound or unresolved slots.

The geometry builder emits one Three.js group per topology face and a material array ordered by the node's stable slot IDs. It publishes that render-material order as `userData.slotIds` and records each face's vertex range in `geometry.userData.blockFaces`. The paint capability re-raycasts the mesh and maps the hit triangle through those ranges to a stable topology face ID, so preview and commit affect only that face. Face UVs retain the world-scale projection contract below.

The block inspector calls this collection **Slots**. Users can rename slots, and the Paint tool changes a slot's material using reusable scene-material datablocks. While one or more faces are selected in edit mode, clicking a slot binds those faces to it immediately; there is no separate Assign / Select / Deselect button row.

Adding a slot while faces are selected creates the slot, binds those faces to it, and assigns a distinct generated accent material in the same scene update. This makes the new surface visibly different in both edit mode and the rendered model before the user chooses a final paint material. With no selected faces, Add Slot is a no-op so it cannot create an invisible, unused slot.

Deleting a non-body slot remaps every assigned face to `body` in the same node update, and `body` becomes the active assignment source. The reusable scene or library material remains available to other nodes.

The global Paint tool resolves the hit face's assigned slot and changes that slot's material binding. A fresh mesh has every face assigned to `body`, so its first paint updates the entire mesh. Once faces are assigned to named slots, painting any one of those faces updates every face using that slot. A one-off material reuses a structurally matching scene material before creating a reusable scene material. Erasing clears the slot binding; `body` returns to the wall-role default and other unbound slots fall back to `body`.

Topology operators preserve assignments deterministically:

- retained and transformed faces keep their slot;
- extrude caps/sides and inset caps/rings inherit the source face;
- loop-cut pieces inherit the face they split;
- bevel bands and mixed-material dissolve use the first adjacent face in stable `topology.faces` order;
- deleting the last face that uses a slot does not delete its reusable material.

### External plugin renderers

Plugin renderers follow the same four axes through the public `@pascal-app/viewer`
surface. For an imported hierarchy, capture its authored materials once and apply
this mapping reactively:

| Host state | Imported material |
|---|---|
| Colored + Rendered | Authored material |
| Colored + Solid | Cached Lambert variant retaining colour, albedo map, alpha, and slots |
| Monochrome | `createSurfaceRoleMaterial(surfaceRole, colorPreset, side, sceneTheme)` |

The adapter belongs to the plugin renderer because it owns the hierarchy and knows
which surfaces are furnishing, glazing, or another role. Material swaps happen on
preference changes, never in `useFrame`. Restore authored materials before disposing
the loader-owned hierarchy, dispose only plugin-owned variants, and leave host-cached
role materials alone.

Edges and the expensive render pipeline do not need a plugin material hook: they are
screen-space host passes over `SCENE_LAYER`. Placement ghosts should use the editor
overlay layer so they remain crisp and do not enter the scene depth/normal targets.

## Scene themes

A `SceneTheme` (`lib/scene-themes.ts`) bundles everything that defines a "look":

| Field | Drives |
|---|---|
| `appearance: 'light' \| 'dark'` | 2D scene chrome — canvas backdrop, grid line colours, measurement-label/cursor contrast. (There is **no** separate light/dark toggle; the theme owns this.) |
| `background` | The 3D backdrop, mixed in `post-processing.tsx` where there is no geometry. |
| `ground` | The site ground fill (`nodes/site/renderer.tsx`) and the infinite ground-occluder plane (`viewer/ground-occluder.tsx`). Kept separate from `background` so dark themes get a lit mid-tone ground instead of near-black. |
| `lights` / `ambient` / `hemi` | The light rig (`lights.tsx`). One key light casts shadows. |
| `toneMappingExposure` | Renderer exposure. |
| `clayTints?` | Per-`SurfaceRole` colour overrides layered on top of `colorPreset` (see [resolving a colour](#resolving-a-colour)). |

The editor UI chrome is always dark (a fixed `document.body.classList.add('dark')`) and is independent of `appearance`.

## Adding a theme

Append a `SceneTheme` to `SCENE_THEMES` with all required fields. `clayTints` is a `Partial` — any role you omit falls back to the active `colorPreset`. The theme pickers (toolbar + community overlay) render a 2×2 swatch from `clayTints` over `background`, so populate at least `wall`/`roof`/`floor`/`glazing` for a good swatch.

## Texture world scale (UVs in metres)

Every procedural surface generates UVs in metres: 1 UV unit = 1 m.

This contract is shared by wall `systems/wall/wall-system.tsx` (`ExtrudeGeometry`), slab `systems/slab/slab-system.tsx` (`generatePositiveSlabGeometry`, and `generatePoolGeometry`), ceiling `systems/ceiling/ceiling-system.tsx`, roof `systems/roof/roof-system.tsx`, and chimney/dormer `nodes/src/chimney/geometry.ts`.

GLB item slots follow the same ~1 UV unit/m authoring convention, enforced by the slot validator's UV-presence check and the Blender recipe in [item-authoring](item-authoring.md). This is an authoring requirement, not a render-time correction.

A catalog material's `repeat` (`mapProperties.repeatX/repeatY` in `packages/core/src/material-library.ts`) is therefore a per-material world-scale setting: tiles per metre.

`repeat: 1` means 1 tile/m, `0.4` means one tile every 2.5 m, and `1.5` means 1.5 tiles/m.

Repeat is a property of the material, identical for every surface that uses it, never per-item or per-surface. Custom repeat values are intentional material scale, not per-surface hacks.
