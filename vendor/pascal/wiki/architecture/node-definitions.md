# Node definitions

*The registry-driven composition model for node kinds.*

Applies to: `packages/core/src/registry/`, `packages/nodes/src/<kind>/`, `packages/viewer/src/components/viewer/{registered-systems.tsx,node-renderer.tsx}`.

A *node kind* — shelf, wall, door, item, spawn, zone — is described by a `NodeDefinition` registered with `nodeRegistry`. The definition is plain data + lazy module references. Three optional fields decide how the kind appears in the scene at runtime; pick whichever combination matches the kind's needs.

This page covers those three fields. For the broader registry contract (schemas, capabilities, parametrics, MCP), see [the registry plan](../../../plans/editor-node-registry.md) in the private repo.

## The three-checkbox model

| Field | Purpose | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| `geometry?: (node, ctx, shading, textures, colorPreset, sceneTheme) => Object3D` | Pure builder. Returns the meshes for this node. The appearance args (after `ctx`) are optional — take them only if the builder picks its own materials. | The kind has parametric meshes that should rebuild when `updateNode` runs. |
| `renderer?: () => Promise<{ default: ComponentType<{ node }> }>` | Optional custom React component. Owns mesh creation. | The kind needs JSX-only features: `<Html>`, `useGLTF`, drei helpers, instancing, TSL shader materials, R3F portals. |
| `system?: () => Promise<{ default: ComponentType }>` | Optional per-frame component (`useFrame` returning `null`). | The kind needs imperative work per frame: animations, opacity transitions, named-mesh material poking, cross-kind dirty cascades. |

The three fields are **independent**. There is no discriminator tag — presence is participation:

```ts
// shelf — pure geometry, no React, no per-frame work
export const shelfDefinition: NodeDefinition<typeof ShelfNode> = {
  // ...
  geometry: buildShelfGeometry,         // pure function in geometry.ts
}

// zone — built once via React (uses <Html>), animated per-frame via system
export const zoneDefinition: NodeDefinition<typeof ZoneNode> = {
  // ...
  renderer: () => import('./renderer'),  // composes <Html> + TSL materials
  system: { module: () => import('./system') },  // pokes uniforms per frame
}

// door — pure geometry + animation system
export const doorDefinition: NodeDefinition<typeof DoorNode> = {
  // ...
  geometry: buildDoorGeometry,
  system: { module: () => import('./animation') },  // advances operationState
}
```

## Runtime: how the three fields are wired

Two framework components live in `packages/viewer/src/components/viewer/`:

- **`<NodeRenderer>`** chooses what React mounts for a node:
  1. If `def.renderer` is set → mount the custom renderer.
  2. Otherwise → mount `<ParametricNodeRenderer>` — a thin empty `<group>` that registers with `sceneRegistry`, attaches pointer handlers via `useNodeEvents`, reads `useLiveTransforms` for drag overrides, and calls `useScene.getState().markDirty(node.id)` on mount.
- **`<GeometrySystem>`** runs every frame:
  1. Read `dirtyNodes` from `useScene`.
  2. For each dirty node whose kind has `def.geometry`, look up the registered `Group` from `sceneRegistry`, build a `GeometryContext`, call `def.geometry(node, ctx, shading, textures, colorPreset, sceneTheme)`, dispose old children, attach the new ones, call `clearDirty(id)`. It re-runs whenever any of those appearance values change.
  3. After building, if `textures` is off and the kind declares `def.surfaceRole`, `GeometrySystem` overrides the built meshes' materials with the themed role colour (`applyDefaultSurfaceRole`).
  4. Kinds with no `def.geometry` are skipped — their custom `def.renderer` handles geometry on its own.

### Hosting declarations

`rendersChildren` describes whether a custom parametric renderer mounts arbitrary child
nodes. It defaults to true for custom renderers; a renderer that filters children or
only draws its own meshes declares `rendersChildren: false`. Geometry-only definitions
inherit child mounting from the generic renderer. Hosting also requires the host schema
to retain the actual child ID in `children`; renderability alone is insufficient.

`capabilities.surfaces.hosting: false` disables surface hosting for a kind.
`capabilities.surfacePlacement: 'floor-only'` prevents that kind from becoming a
hosted child; it does not prevent the kind from hosting other objects. Cabinets,
columns, stairs, elevators and fences use this child-placement restriction.

### `surfaceRole`

A kind may declare `surfaceRole?: SurfaceRole` on its definition. It is a colour token only (`core` stores no material), used to resolve the per-role clay/theme colour for untextured surfaces. See [materials-and-themes](materials-and-themes.md).

Per-kind `def.system` components mount alongside via `<RegisteredSystems>`. They run their own `useFrame` and can mark nodes dirty, address meshes by `getObjectByName`, advance animation state, etc. They run **in addition** to `GeometrySystem`, not instead of it.

### `dirtyTracking`

`dirtyNodes` is the per-frame rebuild queue consumed by `<GeometrySystem>` (`def.geometry`), `<FloorElevationSystem>` (`capabilities.floorPlaced`), and the legacy per-kind viewer systems. Kinds none of those consume — structural/organizational kinds like site, building, level, zone, guide — declare `dirtyTracking: false`. The store's set is a `GuardedDirtySet`: `add()` itself refuses marks for flagged kinds, so both `markDirty` and direct `dirtyNodes.add(...)` calls are covered (blindly marking `node.parentId` is safe — a wall's parent is a level, and the guard drops it). A mark without a consumer would otherwise sit for the whole session, defeat every consumer's empty-set early exit each frame, and pollute the perf overlay's DIRTY readout. If such a kind later gains `def.geometry` (or any other dirty consumer), delete the flag.

## `GeometryContext`

The second arg to `geometry()` is scene read access for builders that reference other nodes by ID. Most kinds ignore it.

```ts
type GeometryContext = {
  resolve: <N = AnyNode>(id: AnyNodeId) => N | undefined
  children: AnyNode[]    // resolved children of this node
  siblings: AnyNode[]    // same kind, same parent (drives wall mitering)
  parent: AnyNode | null
}
```

- **Shelf, spawn, item, column, fence segment** — builder reads only `node`. `ctx` argument unused.
- **Wall** — `ctx.siblings` for corner mitering with adjacent walls. `ctx.children` for cutout footprints (doors / windows hosted on the wall).
- **Door / window** — `ctx.parent` for parent-wall thickness, so the frame depth lines up with the wall it's cut into.

`GeometryContext` exists so builders stay pure (no `useScene` import, no store mutation) and trivially unit-testable. The generic `<GeometrySystem>` builds `ctx` from the current scene snapshot once per dirty node; the cost is a few `Map.get` calls.

For level-scoped batch data (wall mitering across an entire level), `ctx` can be extended with `ctx.levelData?.miters` in a future revision — decided alongside the wall migration (Phase 3 of the registry plan).

## Floor-plan scope

`def.floorplan` is a pure `FloorplanGeometry` builder over the same
`GeometryContext` shape. `def.floorplanScope` controls discovery:

| Scope | Persisted parent | Builder coordinates | `ctx.parent` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `'level'` (default) | active level subtree | building-local metres | semantic parent |
| `'building'` | active building | building-local metres | active level |
| `'site'` | active building's Site | site-local metres | real Site |

The floor-plan layer applies the inverse active-building transform to
site-scoped output and paints that output below level architecture. A plugin
therefore keeps one semantic Site child while the same representation appears
from every level of every building on that Site. Scope discovery is
registry-driven; editor code must not name plugin kinds.

`FloorplanStyle.fillRule` is the winding rule for compound contours. Use
`'evenodd'` when nested rings represent holes; both the interactive SVG
renderer and PDFKit export preserve it. `FloorplanImage.url` may also be an
inline `data:` URL, which PDF export passes directly to PDFKit rather than
through the asset resolver.

## Export-only geometry

`def.bakeGeometry(node, ctx)` replaces the registered node's cloned subtree
only inside `prepareSceneForExport()`. It exists for procedural runtime trees
whose live GPU representation is not a faithful portable artifact—for example,
an instanced maximum population masked by a TSL material.

The hook receives persisted scene data through `GeometryContext` and returns a
new detached, local-space `Object3D`. That return value is the complete static
snapshot for the node. It must use geometry and materials supported by
`GLTFExporter`; the exporter preserves the registered node's transform and
identity. The live editor tree is neither passed to the hook nor mutated.

Use `bake: 'replace'` with `bakeGeometry` when the generic GLB should retain the
portable static snapshot while Pascal's baked viewer hides it and mounts
`bakeReplaceRenderer` for the richer live result.

`def.bakeGeometryAsync(node, ctx)` is the asynchronous counterpart for material
baking and texture reads. Portable export awaits it once instead of invoking the
synchronous hook; synchronous geometry-only callers retain `bakeGeometry`.
Both return detached, local-space trees owned by the export artifact. Context
includes captured materials and level data as well as semantic node lookup.

Model exports accept `excludedNodeTypes?: readonly string[]`. Matching registered
subtrees are omitted before cloning or invoking either builder. Filtering affects
output, not the complete semantic context available to retained builders.

Settings → Export → **Include in file** discovers procedural kinds from
`bakeGeometry`, `bakeGeometryAsync`, or `bake: 'replace'`, including palette-hidden
kinds. Node filters apply to model downloads, not saved-viewer artifacts, print
profiles, scene JSON, or floor-plan PDFs. GLB and USDZ additionally accept
`includedPresentationIds` for explicitly selected static presentation builders;
live presentation subtrees remain outside `scene-renderer` and are never cloned.

Portable GLB/USDZ outputs freeze instancing and deformation and normalize
material textures, vertex colors, sidedness, and reflected geometry. Saved-viewer
artifacts retain their authored animation clips. Preparation captures the source
synchronously, restores viewer state before asynchronous work, and returns an
owned artifact that callers must dispose after serialization or failure.

## Selection presentation

`capabilities.selectionHighlight` controls only the Editor's material-based
selection and hover presentation. It defaults to `true`, including for legacy
and unregistered kinds. Set it to `false` when a node must stay semantically
selected while its rendered subtree keeps plugin-authored materials—for
example, a paint layer whose NodeMaterial carries the result being edited.

The selection manager and outliner query this capability through the registry,
including after late plugin registration. The capability does not change
selectability, inspector ownership, tool activation, keyboard behavior or
deletion policy. Host code must not special-case the opting-out kind.

## Choosing the right combination

### `geometry` only

Use this when the kind's meshes are a pure function of its node data. **Shelf, spawn, item, column, fence segment, wall, door (geometry side), window (geometry side).**

```ts
// packages/nodes/src/shelf/geometry.ts
export function buildShelfGeometry(node: ShelfNode): Group {
  const group = new Group()
  group.add(buildTopBoard(node))
  group.add(buildBracket(node, -1))
  group.add(buildBracket(node, +1))
  return group
}

// packages/nodes/src/shelf/definition.ts
export const shelfDefinition: NodeDefinition<typeof ShelfNode> = {
  // ...
  geometry: buildShelfGeometry,
}
```

No renderer.tsx, no system.tsx. The generic renderer mounts an empty group, the generic system fills it.

### `renderer` only (no `geometry`, no `system`)

Use this when the kind composes its scene via JSX-only features and never needs imperative per-frame work. **GLB-backed items, kinds that mount drei helpers.**

```tsx
// packages/nodes/src/<kind>/renderer.tsx
import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'
import { useRegistry } from '@pascal-app/core'
import { useNodeEvents } from '@pascal-app/viewer'

const FurnitureRenderer = ({ node }: { node: FurnitureNode }) => {
  const ref = useRef<Group>(null!)
  const { scene } = useGLTF(node.asset.url)
  const handlers = useNodeEvents(node, 'furniture')
  useRegistry(node.id, 'furniture', ref)
  return <primitive object={scene.clone()} ref={ref} {...handlers} />
}
```

No `def.geometry` — geometry is the GLB. No `def.system` — there's nothing to animate.

### `renderer` + `system` (no `geometry`)

Use this when the kind's tree contains React-only primitives (e.g. `<Html>`) and needs per-frame imperative work that doesn't rebuild geometry. **Zone.**

The renderer composes the tree once. The system pokes uniforms / opacity / transforms by name:

```tsx
// renderer.tsx
<group ref={ref} {...handlers}>
  <Html name="label" position={centroid}>{node.name}</Html>
  <mesh name="floor" geometry={floorGeometry} material={floorMaterial} />
  <mesh name="walls" geometry={wallGeometry} material={wallMaterial} />
</group>

// system.tsx
useFrame(() => {
  sceneRegistry.byType.zone.forEach((id) => {
    const group = sceneRegistry.nodes.get(id) as Group
    const walls = group.getObjectByName('walls') as Mesh
    const material = walls.material as MeshBasicNodeMaterial
    material.userData.uOpacity.value = lerp(currentOpacity, targetOpacity, lerpSpeed)
  })
})
```

### `geometry` + `system`

Use this when the kind has parametric geometry **and** extra responsibilities. **Door, window.**

- `geometry` builds the visible meshes (frame, panels, hardware) as a pure function of node state + parent wall.
- `system` advances animation (`operationState`) in `useInteractive`. The animation *record itself* is the per-frame rebuild signal — the consumer system rebuilds any node with an active entry (doors) or poses named parts directly (windows). Do **not** `markDirty` per animation tick: a dirty mark is one-shot work that must drain to zero, and per-tick marks keep the scene from ever settling (breaks the `?perf` settle detector and any render-on-demand quiet gate). Mark once when the animation completes so the settled pose gets its rebuild.

This split keeps animation state outside the node schema (it's ephemeral — lives in `useInteractive`) while still re-using the generic rebuild path.

## Named meshes work in either pattern

Setting `mesh.name = 'walls'` is just a three.js property. A system targeting `getObjectByName('walls')` doesn't care whether the mesh was created in JSX (`<mesh name="walls" />`) or imperatively in a pure builder (`mesh.name = 'walls'; group.add(mesh)`). Use whichever fits the kind.

## Migrating from custom renderer+system files to `def.geometry`

If your kind's current system *only* rebuilds geometry on dirty (no animations, no cascades, no material poking), it can collapse to a single `def.geometry` function:

1. Extract the imperative `updateXMesh(node, group)` from the system into a pure `buildXGeometry(node): Group` in `packages/nodes/src/<kind>/geometry.ts`.
2. Replace `def.renderer` with nothing — the framework's `<ParametricNodeRenderer>` covers it.
3. Replace `def.system` with `def.geometry: buildXGeometry`.
4. Delete `renderer.tsx` and `system.tsx`.

If the system also handles cascades, animations, or material updates, keep `def.system` and *also* set `def.geometry` — they run side by side.

## Rules

- **Builders must be pure.** No `useScene` import inside a `def.geometry` function. Read scene state via `ctx`. Mutating the store from a builder breaks idempotence.
- **Builders emit local-space children.** The registered `<group>` is positioned/rotated by `<ParametricNodeRenderer>` via JSX (`position={liveTransform?.position ?? node.position}`). Builders return geometry as if the parent were at the origin — never bake the node's world position into vertex coords.
- **One mesh registered per node ID.** The generic renderer registers a single `<group>` per node. If a custom renderer mounts multiple meshes, register the parent group (or whichever object the system needs to address).
- **Custom systems run in addition to the generic system, not instead of it.** A kind with `def.geometry` + `def.system` will see the generic system rebuild children on dirty AND the per-kind system run its `useFrame`. Plan priorities accordingly: `GeometrySystem` and ceiling dirty consumption run at frame priority 2, after the node batch's priority-1 dirty snapshot. `def.system.priority` orders components, not frame callbacks.
- **Dispose on rebuild.** The generic system disposes the previous children's geometry + material before swapping. Custom systems that imperatively add children must dispose what they replace, or accept the GPU-memory cost.
- **`def.renderer` overrides the generic renderer.** Once you set it, you own the mount — `<ParametricNodeRenderer>` is not invoked. The generic geometry system still runs for the kind if `def.geometry` is set, so a custom renderer can register an empty group and let the system fill it.

## `toolHints`

`toolHints?: ToolHint[]` is the registry-owned source for the floating helper shown while
a registered placement or draw tool is active.

```ts
type ToolHint = {
  key: string
  label: string
}
```

Keep labels short and action-oriented. Prefer the default guided-building language:
snapping, angle increments, guides, and validation are active unless the user holds Shift
during the gesture. A `Shift` hint should describe the bypass in user terms, such as
`Free angle`, `Free place`, or `Bypass guided constraints`.

`HelperManager` renders `def.toolHints` through `RegisteredToolHelper`, and active Shift
state can update the row to show that guided constraints are currently bypassed.
`affordanceHints?: Record<string, ToolHint[]>` is the same contract for a kind's own
reshapes, keyed like `affordanceTools`: while a node of the kind is in that `reshaping`
scope the HUD shows those hints instead of the generic reshape rows (the wall split's
cut-count chip lives there). Select
mode is not owned by a node definition, so its helper is derived separately from
selection state, selected-node move/rotate capabilities, and held modifiers.

## Pitfalls

### `<GeometrySystem>` must not mutate `group.position` / `group.rotation`

`ParametricNodeRenderer` binds `<group position={liveTransform?.position ?? node.position}>` and the matching rotation via JSX. React only re-applies the prop when its underlying value changes. If the geometry system imperatively zeroes `group.position` after a rebuild — as legacy per-kind systems used to — R3F has no reason to re-render on the next tick and the group stays at the origin. Symptom: the node visually snaps to `(0, 0, 0)` whenever its geometry rebuilds (move commit, dimension change, paint).

The contract is the other way around now: builders produce local-space children; the renderer owns the transform; the system only swaps children.

### Tag geometry-built children with `userData.__fromGeometry`

A registered `<group>` can host **two** kinds of children: meshes the geometry builder created (boards, posts, dividers) and React-rendered hosted nodes (items reparented onto a shelf surface). When the system rebuilds, it must dispose only the previous geometry pass — disposing React-mounted children would tear out their meshes mid-mount, leaving the hosted node in scene state but invisible. Symptom: dragging an item onto a shelf makes the item disappear and never come back.

`<GeometrySystem>` tags every child returned by the builder with `userData.__fromGeometry = true` and `disposeChildren` only removes/disposes children carrying the marker. Custom systems that imperatively add children to a registered group must follow the same convention if hosted children are possible.

### Previews must clone materials before mutating them

`def.preview` typically calls the kind's geometry builder, then walks the resulting meshes and sets `material.transparent = true; material.opacity = 0.5` for a ghosted look. If the builder caches materials at module scope — and shelf, item, and most cache-friendly kinds do, keyed on `material` / `materialPreset` — every committed instance of the kind in the scene shares one material instance. Mutating it in the preview leaks the translucency into every real node that uses the default material; placed shelves render see-through, placed items lose their opacity, etc.

The fix is to clone in the preview, mutate the clone, and reassign `mesh.material` to the clone. On unmount, dispose only the clones — **never** the original returned by the builder, which other nodes still reference. `nodes/src/shelf/preview.tsx` is the reference implementation.

### Host kinds need a `children` field on the schema

If your kind declares `relations.hosts: [...]`, add `children: z.array(...).default([])` to the schema. `useScene.createNode(child, parentId)` writes `child.parentId = parentId` **and** appends `child.id` to `parent.children`. Without the field, the parent-side write is a no-op — `<ParametricNodeRenderer>`'s `n.children.map(...)` then has nothing to mount and the host renderer never sees the new child. Symptom: hosted node lives in `useScene.nodes` but no React mount fires, so the host's tree-node sidebar entry is empty and the 3D scene shows nothing where the host should pick it up.

Migrations matter: if your kind shipped before hosting was added, patch existing nodes in `migrateNodes` so `Array.isArray(node.children)` holds for every loaded scene before the renderer reads it.

## Capability reference

### `capabilities.roofAccessory`

Marks a kind as a roof-segment-mounted accessory (chimney, dormer, skylight, solar-panel, ridge-vent, box-vent). Presence tells the viewer's roof-merge loop two things:

1. **Dirty cascade.** When the accessory is dirtied (move / resize / reparent), the host segment's parent roof queues a re-merge so its merged shell re-CSGs with the updated cut. The merge loop clears the accessory's dirty bit and queues the parent roof.
2. **Optional CSG cut.** When `buildCut` is set, the merge loop subtracts the returned geometry from the host segment's shin / deck / wall brushes. Returned geometry must be **segment-local**; the viewer handles vertex welding, material group attachment, and `three-bvh-csg` brush wrapping so core stays free of three-bvh-csg deps.

```ts
type RoofAccessoryConfig = {
  buildCut?: (node: AnyNode, hostSegment: AnyNode) => BufferGeometry | null
}
```

Set `buildCut` for kinds that cut **through** the roof (skylight, dormer). Kinds that sit **on top** (vents, solar panels) declare the capability without `buildCut` — the cascade still fires but no CSG cut runs.

```ts
// skylight — cuts through the roof
capabilities: {
  roofAccessory: {
    buildCut: (node, hostSegment) => buildSkylightRoofCut(node, hostSegment),
  },
},

// box-vent — sits on top, no cut needed
capabilities: {
  roofAccessory: {},
},
```

---

### `capabilities.paint`

Per-kind paint dispatch. Lets the editor's `selection-manager` route paint hover / click / preview through a generic dispatcher instead of adding an `if (node.type === '<kind>')` arm for every paintable kind.

The capability owns four decisions:

1. **`resolveRole`** — which logical surface the pointer clicked. Returns `null` when the face shouldn't be painted (interior slot, oblique normal, etc.).
2. **`buildPatch`** — the node-update partial to commit on click.
3. **`applyPreview`** — applies a preview material to the mesh subtree and returns a cleanup callback. Returns `null` when the mesh isn't mounted yet; the editor falls back to the not-allowed cursor.
4. **`getEffectiveMaterial`** *(optional)* — reads the currently-effective material for a role, walking any parent-fallback chain. Drives the color picker's current-value indicator.

```ts
type PaintCapability = {
  resolveRole: (args: PaintResolveArgs) => string | null
  buildPatch: (args: PaintPatchArgs) => Partial<AnyNode>
  applyPreview: (args: PaintPreviewArgs) => (() => void) | null
  getEffectiveMaterial?: (args: PaintEffectiveMaterialArgs) => {
    material: MaterialSchema | undefined
    materialPreset: string | undefined
  } | null
}
```

Implement the capability in a `paint.ts` file next to `definition.ts`. Keep it pure — no `useScene`, no store mutation. Reference implementations: `packages/nodes/src/chimney/paint.ts` (body/top split), `packages/nodes/src/wall/paint.ts` (interior/exterior + normal-based disambiguation).

```ts
capabilities: {
  paint: chimneyPaint,  // imported from ./paint.ts
},
```

---

### `keyboardActions`

Registry-driven R / T key handlers. A kind that wants to override the R (`rotate clockwise`) or T (`rotate counter-clockwise`) keystroke sets this field on its `NodeDefinition` instead of extending the hand-written `if/else` chain in `use-keyboard.ts`.

```ts
type KeyboardActions = {
  r?: KeyboardAction  // R / Shift+R primary action
  t?: KeyboardAction  // T / Shift+T secondary action
}

type KeyboardAction = {
  /**
   * Return false to fall through to the editor's default rotation
   * behaviour. Use this to short-circuit the action for non-operable
   * type variants (e.g. a fixed skylight should rotate, not toggle).
   */
  appliesTo: (node: AnyNode) => boolean
  /**
   * Execute the action. The editor handles preventDefault and the
   * shared sfx; only touch scene / interactive state here.
   */
  run: (node: AnyNode) => void
}
```

```ts
// skylight — R toggles open/closed on operable types; T forces close
keyboardActions: {
  r: {
    appliesTo: (node) => node.type === 'skylight' && isOperableSkylightNode(node),
    run: (node) => toggleSkylightOpenState(node.id),
  },
  t: {
    appliesTo: (node) => node.type === 'skylight' && isOperableSkylightNode(node),
    run: (node) => closeSkylightOpenState(node.id),
  },
},
```

Door and window still use legacy direct calls in `use-keyboard.ts`; migrating them under this capability is a follow-up.
