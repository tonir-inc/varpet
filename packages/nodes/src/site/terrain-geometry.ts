 * Builds the terrain mesh buffers from a `TerrainField`.
 *
 * Split out of the renderer as pure array math so the vertex layout is
 * unit-testable without a canvas, and so the partial-upload path has one
 * definition. The renderer owns the `BufferGeometry`; this owns what goes in it.
 *
 * The triangulation this file emits is the convention `surfaceHeightAt`
 * (`core/lib/terrain-field.ts`) reads back: two triangles per cell split along the
 * `(c+1,r)`–`(c,r+1)` diagonal. Anything drawn *on* the ground samples that
 * function, so changing the winding below without changing it there would make
 * every draped line sink into half of every cell.
 *
 * Two rules that are easy to get wrong and expensive to debug:
 *
 * - **Normals are analytic, never `computeVertexNormals()`.** Beyond the cost
 *   (~1.5 ms at 257²), `computeVertexNormals()` rewrites the *whole* normal
 *   attribute, which silently defeats the dirty-rect partial upload that makes
 *   sculpting cheap. `normalAt` central-differences the field instead, so a
 *   patch touches only its footprint and the neighbouring normals.
 * - **Vertices are one-per-sample and shared between triangles**, so a partial
 *   upload is a contiguous row range. Duplicating verts per-triangle for flat
 *   shading would triple memory and scatter the dirty range.
