/**
 * Scene IBL — a small procedural gradient sky (cool zenith → warm horizon →
 * dim ground bounce) used purely as the environment light source. The visible
 * backdrop stays the flat theme background (composited in post-processing);
 * this texture is never shown. Replaces the old `venice_sunset_1k.hdr` fetch:
 * no network dependency, and the vertical color split means upward-facing
 * surfaces read cooler than vertical ones instead of everything getting the
 * same directionless warm wash. Exported as an opt-in <Viewer> child so
 * embed / thumbnail surfaces that don't want IBL simply don't mount it.
 * Only affects `rendered` shading (Lambert ignores env maps).
