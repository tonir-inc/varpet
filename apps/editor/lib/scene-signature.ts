/**
 * Identity of a graph for echo detection, compared across a boundary that
 * normalizes: one side is a raw SSE payload, the other is the editor's state
 * after `applySceneGraphToEditor` ran. `setScene` always writes `collections`,
 * `materials` and `installedPlugins`, so a payload that omits them (MCP live
 * sync emits exactly that) has to serialize the same as the store that
 * defaulted them, or the echo reads as a local edit and gets saved back.
 *
 * Every field the PUT body carries has to appear here. A field that is
 * persisted but unsigned makes a local change to *only* that field
 * indistinguishable from an echo, and the save is skipped.
