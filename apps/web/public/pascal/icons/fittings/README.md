# Fitting thumbnails

Generated with the built-in image generation tool using `../duct-fitting.webp` as the style reference. The existing duct elbow keeps that original icon.

The generator emits a large PNG; re-encode it before committing, because these ship in the portable CLI runtime and render at 56 px:

```sh
cwebp -q 85 -m 6 -alpha_q 100 -resize 256 256 <name>.png -o <name>.webp
```

## Prompt template

Create one catalog thumbnail asset for SUBJECT. Reference image is STYLE REFERENCE ONLY. Match its polished lavender purple 3D isometric product icon, soft lilac highlights, darker violet interiors, fine bright edges. Actual subject must be SUBJECT, not the reference elbow. Single isolated object centered, occupying 78% of square canvas. Three-quarter view from above showing its identifying geometry clearly at 56px. Transparent background, no floor, no text, no labels, no watermark, no additional objects. Save generated asset. Asset identifier NAME.
